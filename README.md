# Filtering_by_DFT
Remove two tones and signals above 20kHz in time domain.
## Dataset
1. Ascience-Fast-Piano.wav : music without noise  
2. Ascience-Fast-Piano-Add-Tones.wav : music polluted by 2 tones(one tone frequency > 15000Hz, one tone frequency < 100Hz.) *Hint :  In about 0.2 seconds of the beginning of the music, there is only noise of two tones.  

## Requirement
1. Use argc and argv
2. Type in FILE.exe Ascience-Fast-Piano-Add-Tones.wav output.wav in cmd to execute program.

## Implementation
Detail is in the report folder.
